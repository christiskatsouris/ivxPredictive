# ivxPredictive : Unified Inference with General Autoregressive Roots

Summary: This package aims to implement robust statistical inference methodologies for predictive regressions across the spectrum of autoregressive regimes as defined in the paper of Katsouris C. (working paper, 2022). Specifically, the proposed framework extends the original IVX instrumentation of [Phillips and Magdalinos (2009)](https://ideas.repec.org/p/skb/wpaper/cofie-06-2009.html) and [Kostakis, Magdalinos and Stamatogiannis (2015)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/5/1506/1867633?login=true) to a more general autoregressive dependence for both linear and quantile specifications (see, also [Katsouris, C. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02073)).  

# Installation (under development) 

The R package will be able to be installed from Github.
