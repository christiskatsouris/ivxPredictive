# ivxPredictive 

## Unified Inference with General Autoregressive Roots

Description: The package aims to implement robust statistical inference methodologies for predictive regressions across the spectrum of autoregressive regimes as defined in the paper of Magdalinos and Phillips (2020) and Katsouris C. (working paper, 2022). In particular, the proposed framework extends the original IVX instrumentation of [Phillips and Magdalinos (2009)](https://ideas.repec.org/p/skb/wpaper/cofie-06-2009.html) and [Kostakis, Magdalinos and Stamatogiannis (2015)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/5/1506/1867633?login=true) to a more general autoregressive dependence for both linear (see, Magdalinos and Petrova (2022)) and conditional quantile specifications (see, [Katsouris, C. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02073)).  

## Installation (under development) 

The R package ‘ivxPredictive’ will be able to be installed from Github.
